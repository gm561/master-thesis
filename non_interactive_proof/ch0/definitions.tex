\begin{definition} {\textbf{Dynamic weakly verifiable puzzle (non interactive version)}}\\
  A dynamic weakly verifiable puzzle (DWVP) is defined by a probabilistic algorithm $P(\pi)$,
  called a problem poser, that takes as input chosen uniformly at random bitstring $\pi \in \{0,1\}^l$,
  and produces circuits $\Gamma_{V}$, $\Gamma_{H}$ and a puzzle $x \in \{0,1\}^{*}$.
  The circuit $\Gamma_{V}$ takes as its input $q \in Q$ and an answer $y$.
  If $\Gamma_V(q,y) = 1$ then $y$ is a correct solution of puzzle $x$ for $q$.
  The circuit $\Gamma_H$ on input $q$ provides a hint such that $\Gamma_V(q,\Gamma_H(q)) = 1$.
  The algorithm $S$, called a solver, has oracle access to $\Gamma_V$ and $\Gamma_H$.
  The calls of $S$ to $\Gamma_V$ are called verification queries and the calls to $\Gamma_H$ are hint queries.
  The solver $S$ can ask at most $h$ hint queries, $v$ verification queries, and successfully solves a DWVP if and only if
  it makes a verification query $(q,y)$ such that $\Gamma_V(q,y) = 1$, when it has not previously asked for a hint query on this $q$.

\begin{definition}{\textbf{$k$-wise direct product of dynamic weakly verifiable puzzles}}\\
Let $g: \{0,1\}^{k} \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ be a monotone function, and $P^{(1)}$ a probabilistic algorithm used to generate an instance of DWVP.
A $k$-wise direct product of dynamic weakly verifiable puzzles is defined by a probabilistic algorithm $P^{(g)}\left(\pi_1, \dots, \pi_k \right)$,
where $(\pi_1, \dots, \pi_k) \in \{0,1\}^{k \cdot l}$ are chosen uniformly at random.
$P^{(g)}\left(\pi_1, \dots, \pi_k \right)$ sequentially generates $k$ independent instances of dynamic weakly verifiable puzzles,
where in the $i$-th round $P^{(g)}$ runs $P^{(1)}(\pi_i)$ and obtains $(x_i, \Gamma_V^{(i)}, \Gamma_H^{(i)} )$.
Finally, $P^{(g)}$ outputs a verification circuit
\begin{align*}
  \Gamma_V^{(g)} (q, y_1, \dots, y_k) := g(\Gamma_V^{(1)}(q, y_1), \dots, \Gamma_V^{(k)}(q, y_k)),
\end{align*}
a hint circuit
\begin{align*}
  \Gamma_H^{(k)} (q) := (\Gamma_H^{(1)}(q), \dots, \Gamma_H^{(k)}(q)),
\end{align*}
and a puzzle $x^{(k)} := (x_1, \dots, x_k)$.
\\
The probabilistic algorithm $S$, called a solver, has oracle access to $\Gamma_V^{(g)}, \Gamma_H^{(k)}$.
The solver $S$ can ask at most $v$ verification queries to $\Gamma_V^{(g)}$, $h$ hint queries to $\Gamma_H^{(k)}$ and successfully solves the puzzle $x^{(k)}$
if and only if it asks a verification query $(q, y_1, \dots, y_k)$ such that $\Gamma_V^{(g)}(q, y_1, \dots, y_k) = 1$, and it has not previously asked for a hint query on this $q$.

% TODO oracle access to P^{g} of Gen
\begin{theorem}{\textbf{Security amplification of a dynamic weakly verifiable puzzle.}}\\
  For a fixed problem poser $P^{(1)}$ there exists an algorithm $Gen(C, g, \varepsilon, \delta, n, v, h)$ which takes as input a solver circuit $C$ for $k$-wise
  direct product of DWVP, a monotone function $g$, parameters $\varepsilon, \delta,n$, the number of verification $v$, and hint $h$ queries asked by $C$, and outputs a circuit $D$
  such that following holds: \\
  If $C$ is such that \\
  \begin{align*}
    \underset{(\pi_1, \dots, \pi_k) \in \{0,1\}^{kl}}{\Pr}[A^{P^{(g)}, C}(\pi_1, \dots, \pi_k) = 1] \geq \underset{\mu \leftarrow \mu_\delta^k}{\Pr}[g(\mu) = 1] + \varepsilon
  \end{align*}
  then $D$ satisfies almost surely
  \begin{align*}
    \underset{\pi \in \{0,1\}^{l}}{\Pr}[A^{P^{(1)},D}(\pi) = 1] \geq (\delta + \frac{\varepsilon}{6k})
  \end{align*}
  Additionally, $D$ and $Gen$ require only oracle access to $g$ and $C$. Furthermore, $D$ asks at most $h$ hint queries, $v$ verification queries and
  $Size(D) \leq Size(C)\frac{6k}{\varepsilon}$ and $Time(Gen) = poly(k, \frac{1}{\varepsilon}, n, v, h)$.
