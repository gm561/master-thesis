\subsection{Optimality of the result}
\label{st:discussion}

\begin{todo}
  \textbf{TODO:} When does p.r. fails to a.h. \\
  \textbf{TODO:} Why fixing all puzzles is not possible \\
  \textbf{TODO:} Why we believe that it is not possible to do any better \\
  \textbf{TODO:} Mention the number of the verification queries  \\
  \textbf{TODO:} Try to explain somehow the number of hint queries \\
  \textbf{TOOD:} What we tried to prove the lower bound \\
  \textbf{TOOD:} Why it was not possible \\

  - no easy way to handle inefficient solver without visible effect on the number of hint queries \\
  - complicated breaker + puzzles has to depend on each other, \\
  - has to ask many hint and verification queries in each phase on the more less the same domain \\
  - it interacts with the solver that is computationally bounded, hence limitation on the number of hint and verification queries \\
  - the solver may be dishonest answer the queries with different (not true response)
