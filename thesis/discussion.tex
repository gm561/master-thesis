A natural question is whether one can improve the result in Theorem \ref{th:sec_amp_for_dwvp} such that a solver $C$ for the $k$-wise direct product of puzzles that satisfies
\begin{align}
    \label{weakerAssumptions}
    \underset{\substack{\pi^{(k)} \in \{0,1\}^{kn} \\ \rho \in \{0,1\}^{*}}}{\Pr}\left[\mathit{Success}^{P_{kn}^{(g)}, C}(\pi^{(k)}, \rho) = 1\right]
    \geq \underset{u \leftarrow \mu_\delta^k}{\Pr}[g(u) = 1] + \varepsilon
\end{align}
suffices to obtain a solver $D$ for a single puzzle that with high probability satisfies
  \begin{align}
    \underset{\substack{\pi \in \{0,1\}^{n} \\ \rho \in \{0,1\}^{*}}}
    {\Pr}\left[\Success^{P_{n}^{(1)},D}(\pi, \rho) = 1\right] \geq \delta + \frac{\epsilon}{6k}.
  \end{align}
In Theorem \ref{th_sec_amp_dwvp_assum} we lose the factor $\frac{1}{16(h+v)}$ because of the domain partitioning that let us avoid collisions between hint and verification queries.

We do not see how to find a more efficient partitioning such that the assumption \eqref{weakerAssumptions} is sufficient.
We also tried unsuccessfully other methods:
\begin{enumerate}[-]
  \item Showing that the influence of hint queries can be somehow bounded such that the weaker assumption \eqref{weakerAssumptions} holds. \\
  \item Amending the algorithm $\Gen$ such that only one call to the solver for the $k$-wise direct product of puzzles is necessary.
\end{enumerate}

It seems that we must loose a factor $\frac{1}{v}$ as we allow the solver $D$ to make just a single verification query.
For example, let $C_v$ be a solver for the $1$-wise direct product that asks no hint queries and at most $v$ verification queries.
Additionally, $C_v$ succeeds with probability $1$ and a verification query on which it succeeds is chosen uniformly at random from $\{0,1, \cdots, v\}$.
All queries except this one are unsuccessful.
Thus, in a situation where we allow to ask only a single verification query we do not see a way to succeed with probability higher than~$\frac{1}{v}$.

Therefore, we tried to show that the result obtained in Theorem \ref{th:sec_amp_for_dwvp} is optimal.

We also tried to apply the \textit{black box separation technique} by Holenstein and Haitner \cite{haitner2009possibility}.
The intuition, behind our approach was to use a solver for the $k$-wise direct product that asks a large number of hint queries such that
the success probability of $C$ in every next run decreases drastically.
However, in our setting it only makes sense to consider situations where the number of hint and verification queries is bounded by some polynomial.
Furthermore, the solver for the $k$-wise direct product cannot solve puzzle on each position independently (in this setting it is possible
to prove the hardness amplification with a bound as in \ref{weakerAssumptions}).
Finally, we assume that the solver $C$ for the $k$-wise direct product of puzzles may not obtain direct access to hint and verification oracles.
Instead, the queries are answered by the solver circuit $D$ for a single puzzle that runs $C$. We cannot exclude a situation where $D$ is dishonest.
This makes the black-box separation proof fairly complicated so that we do not see a way to apply this technique in our setting.

Full domain hash (FDH) is a type of a signature scheme that can be seen as dynamic weakly verifiable puzzle.
Coron \cite{coron2000exact, coron2002optimal} proves that security of RSA implies security of FDH.
Loosely speaking, he shows that if there is no efficient algorithm that breaks the security of RSA with probability higher
than $\epsilon_{\mathit{RSA}}$ then there is no algorithm that breaks security of FDH with probability higher than
$\epsilon_{\mathit{FDH}} \approx h \cdot \epsilon_{\mathit{RSA}}$ where $h$ is the number of hint queries that a solver makes when solving FDH.
Coron shows that this result is optimal. However, we do not see how the technique used in \cite{coron2002optimal} can be used in our setting.

Therefore, the question whether the result in Theorem \ref{th:sec_amp_for_dwvp} is optimal remains open.
