\section{Proof of the Hardness Amplification}
\label{st:main_theorem}%
\subsection{The hardness amplification theorem}
\label{subst:main_theorem}%
Let us remind the experiment \textit{Success} defined in Chapter \ref{ch:diwvp_main_thm}.
We denote the problem poser by $P$ and the solver by $C$. Additionally, let $\pi$ and $\rho$ be the randomness of the problem poser and solver, respectively.

\success*

Without loss of generality throughout this chapter we make the assumption that $C$ does not ask verification queries on $q \in \cQ$
for which a hint query has been asked before. Furthermore, we assume that once $C$ asked
a verification query that succeeds, it does not ask any further hint or verification queries.

Let us remind the hardness amplification theorem for dynamic interactive weakly verifiable puzzles stated in Chapter \ref{ch:diwvp_main_thm}.
