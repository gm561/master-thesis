\section{Proof of Hardness Amplification}
In this section we give a proof of hardness amplification for dynamic interactive weakly verifiable puzzles.
\label{st:main_theorem}%
\subsection{The hardness amplification theorem}
\label{subst:main_theorem}%
Let us remind the experiment \textit{Success} defined in Chapter \ref{ch:diwvp_main_thm}.
We denote the problem poser by $P$ and the solver by $C$. Additionally, let $\pi$ and $\rho$ be the randomness used by
the problem poser and the solver, respectively.

\success*

Without loss of generality throughout this chapter we make the assumption that $C$ does not ask verification queries on $q \in \cQ$
for which a hint query has been asked before. Furthermore, we assume that once $C$ asked
a verification query that succeeds, it does not ask any further hint or verification queries.

We state the hardness amplification theorem for dynamic interactive weakly verifiable puzzles as in Chapter \ref{ch:diwvp_main_thm}.
