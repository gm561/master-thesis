\chapter{Weakly Verifiable Cryptographic Primitives}
This chapter gives an overview of dynamic interactive weakly verifiable puzzles.
We start by formulating the definition of dynamic interactive weakly verifiable puzzles.
To familiarize Reader with this notion and provide more intuition, in Section \ref{section:wvp_examples}, we describe
a~series of well known cryptographic primitives that are captured by this notion.
The Section \ref{st:previous_results} is devoted to the previous research concerning weakly verifiable puzzles.

\section{Dynamic Interactive Weakly Verifiable Puzzles}
\label{section:wvp}
We define \textit{dynamic interactive weakly verifiable puzzles} as follows.
\begin{definition}[Dynamic Interactive Weakly Verifiable Puzzle.]
  \label{def:dwvp}
  A \textnormal{dynamic interactive weakly verifiable puzzle (DIWVP)} is defined by a family of probabilistic circuits $\{P_n\}_{n \in \N}$.
  A circuit belonging to $\{P_n\}_{n \in \N}$ is called a problem poser.
  A solver $C_n := (C_1, C_2)$ for $P_n$ is a probabilistic two phase circuit.
  We write $P_n(\pi)$ to denote the execution of $P_n$ with the randomness fixed to $\pi \in \{0,1\}^n$ and $C_n(\rho) := (C_1,C_2)(\rho)$
  to denote the execution of both $C_1$ and $C_2$ with the randomness fixed to $\rho \in \{0,1\}^{*}$.

  In the first phase, the problem poser $P_n(\pi)$ and the solver $C_1(\rho)$ interact.
  As the result of the interaction $P_n(\pi)$ outputs a verification circuit $\Gamma_{V}$ and a hint circuit $\Gamma_{H}$.
  The circuit $C_1(\rho)$ produces no output.
  The circuit $\Gamma_{V}$ takes as input $q \in Q$, an answer $y \in \{0,1\}^*$
  and outputs a bit. We say that an answer $(q,y)$ is a correct solution if and only if $\Gamma_V(q,y) = 1$.
  The circuit $\Gamma_H$ on input $q \in Q$ outputs a hint such that $\Gamma_V(q,\Gamma_H(q))~=~1$.

  In the second phase, $C_2$ takes as input $x := \langle P_n(\pi), C_1(\rho) \rangle_{\mathit{trans}}$
  and has oracle access to $\Gamma_V$ and $\Gamma_H$.
  The execution of $C_2$ with the input $x$ and the randomness fixed to $\rho$
  is denoted by $C_2(x, \rho)$. The queries of $C_2$ to $\Gamma_V$ and $\Gamma_H$ are called verification queries and hint queries respectively.
  We say that the circuit $C_2$ \textnormal{succeeds} if and only if it makes a verification query $(q,y)$ such that $\Gamma_V(q,y)~=~1$
  and it has not previously asked for a hint query on $q$.
\end{definition}

We use the term weakly verifiable to emphasize that there is no easy way
for a solver to check correctness of a solution, except asking a verification query.

We call a puzzle \textit{dynamic} if the number of hint queries is greater than zero.
Furthermore, we say that a puzzle is \textit{interactive} if in the first
phase the number of messages exchanged between a problem poser and a problem solver is greater than one.

Definition \ref{def:dwvp} generalizes and combines previous approaches that studies
\textit{weakly verifiable puzzles} \cite{canetti2004hardness},
\textit{dynamic weakly verifiable puzzles} \cite{Dodis:2009:SAI:1530441.1530450}
and \textit{interactive weakly verifiable puzzles} \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1002-3534}.

\begin{todo}
  \textbf{TODO:}
  This is not obvious as:
  a) algorithms are in BPP but they are search problems so no direct use of Cook-Levin
  b) this theorem is for deterministic algorithms
\end{todo}

There is no loss of generality in assuming that a problem poser and a problem solver are defined by probabilistic circuits.
Definition \ref{def:dwvp} embraces also a case where a problem poser and a problem solver are probabilistic polynomial time algorithms.
We use the well know fact \cite{LectureNotesCT} that polynomial time algorithms can be transform into equivalent family of Boolean circuits of polynomial size.
