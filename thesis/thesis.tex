\chapter{Weakly Verifiable Cryptographic Primitives}
This chapter gives an overview of dynamic interactive weakly verifiable puzzles.
In Section~\ref{section:wvp} we define dynamic interactive weakly verifiable puzzles.
Next, in Section~\ref{section:wvp_examples}, we describe a series of cryptographic primitives
that are captured by the notion of dynamic interactive weakly verifiable puzzles.
The Section \ref{st:previous_results} is devoted to the previous research concerning weakly verifiable puzzles.

\section{Dynamic Interactive Weakly Verifiable Puzzles}
\label{section:wvp}
We consider the following definition of \textit{dynamic interactive weakly verifiable puzzles}.
\begin{definition}[Dynamic Interactive Weakly Verifiable Puzzle.]
  \label{def:dwvp}
  A \textnormal{dynamic interactive weakly verifiable puzzle (DIWVP)} is defined by a family of probabilistic circuits $\{P_n\}_{n \in \N}$.
  A circuit belonging to $\{P_n\}_{n \in \N}$ is called a problem poser.
  A solver $C_n := (C_1, C_2)$ for $P_n$ is a probabilistic two phase circuit.
  We write $P_n(\pi)$ to denote the execution of $P_n$ with the randomness fixed to $\pi \in \{0,1\}^n$, and $C_n(\rho) := (C_1,C_2)(\rho)$
  to denote the execution of both $C_1$ and $C_2$ with the randomness fixed to $\rho \in \{0,1\}^{*}$.

  In the first phase, the problem poser $P_n(\pi)$ and the solver $C_1(\rho)$ interact.
  As the result of the interaction $P_n(\pi)$ outputs a verification circuit $\Gamma_{V}$ and a hint circuit $\Gamma_{H}$.
  The circuit $C_1(\rho)$ produces no output.
  The circuit $\Gamma_{V}$ takes as input $q \in Q$, an answer $y \in \{0,1\}^*$
  and outputs a bit. We say that an answer $(q,y)$ is a correct solution if and only if $\Gamma_V(q,y) = 1$.
  The circuit $\Gamma_H$ on input $q \in Q$ outputs a hint such that $\Gamma_V(q,\Gamma_H(q)) = 1$.

  In the second phase, $C_2$ takes as input $x := \langle P_n(\pi), C_1(\rho) \rangle_{\mathit{trans}}$,
  and has oracle access to $\Gamma_V$ and $\Gamma_H$.
  The execution of $C_2$ with the input $x$ and the randomness fixed to $\rho$
  is denoted by $C_2(x, \rho)$. The queries of $C_2$ to $\Gamma_V$ and $\Gamma_H$ are called verification queries and hint queries respectively.
  We say that the circuit $C_2$ \textnormal{succeeds} if and only if it makes a verification query $(q,y)$ such that $\Gamma_V(q,y) = 1$,
  and it has not previously asked for a hint query on $q$.
\end{definition}

If for a certain DIWVP the number of hint queries is greater than zero, we say that such
a puzzle is \textit{dynamic}. Conversely, if a problem poser is not allowed to ask any hint queries, then such a puzzle
is called \textit{non-dynamic}.

We say that DIWVP is \textit{interactive} if in the first phase the number of messages exchanged between a problem poser and a problem
solver is greater than one.

Definition \ref{def:dwvp} generalizes and combines previous approaches of
\textit{weakly verifiable puzzles} \cite{canetti2004hardness},
\textit{dynamic weakly verifiable puzzles} \cite{Dodis:2009:SAI:1530441.1530450}
and \textit{interactive weakly verifiable puzzles} \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1002-3534}.

\begin{todo}
  \textbf{TODO:}
  This is not obvious as:
  a) algorithms are in BPP but they are search problems so no direct use of Cook-Levin
  b) this theorem is for deterministic algorithms
\end{todo}

There is no loss of generality in assuming that a problem poser and a problem solver are defined by probabilistic circuits.
Definition \ref{def:dwvp} embraces also a case where a problem poser and a problem solver are probabilistic polynomial time algorithms.
We use the well know fact \cite{LectureNotesCT} that polynomial time algorithms can be transform into equivalent family of Boolean circuits of polynomial size.
