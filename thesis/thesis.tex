%% ========

%% LaTeX Font encoding -- DO NOT CHANGE
\usepackage[OT1]{fontenc}

%% Babel provides support for languages.  'english' uses British
%% English hyphenation and text snippets like "Figure" and
%% "Theorem". Use the option 'ngerman' if your document is in German.
%% Use 'american' for American English.  Note that if you change this,
%% the next LaTeX run may show spurious errors.  Simply run it again.
%% If they persist, remove the .aux file and try again.
\usepackage[english]{babel}

%% Input encoding 'utf8'. In some cases you might need 'utf8x' for
%% extra symbols. Not all editors, especially on Windows, are UTF-8
%% capable, so you may want to use 'latin1' instead.
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}

%% This changes default fonts for both text and math mode to use Herman Zapfs
%% excellent Palatino font.  Do not change this.
%\usepackage[sc]{mathpazo}

%% The AMS-LaTeX extensions for mathematical typesetting.  Do not
%% remove.
\usepackage{amsmath,amssymb,amsfonts,mathrsfs}

%% NTheorem is a reimplementation of the AMS Theorem package. This

%% We unfortunately need this for the Rules chapter.  Remove it

\chapter{Weakly Verifiable Cryptographic Primitives}
\label{ch:intro_weakly}
This chapter gives an overview of weakly verifiable cryptograph primitives.
We start by formulating a definition of a \textit{dynamic interactive weakly verifiable puzzle} in Section \ref{section:wvp}.
To provide the Reader more intuition in Section \ref{section:wvp_examples} we describe a~series of well known cryptographic primitives
that are weakly verifiable. Section \ref{st:previous_results} is devoted to the previous research concerning different types of weakly verifiable puzzles.

\chapter{Hardness amplification for weakly verifiable puzzles}
\label{ch:main_result}
In the previous chapter we gave an overview of the former studies of different types of weakly verifiable puzzles.
We also defined a~more general notion of a~dynamic interactive weakly verifiable puzzle.
The focus of this chapter is on a constructive proof of hardness amplification for dynamic interactive weakly verifiable puzzles.
In Section \ref{st:main_theorem} we formulate the theorem which is then proved in the succeeding sections.
We begin with constructing an algorithm that finds an efficiently computable function that is used
to partition the domain of hint and verification queries. Next, we give a proof of hardness amplification
under the assumption that the domain is well partitioned. Finally, in Section \ref{st:put_together}
we finish the proof by combining the previous steps.
