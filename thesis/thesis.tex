\chapter{Introduction}
Studying security amplification is a significant issue in cryptography.
In absence of good proofs for lower bounds we are often interested in studying
whether under the assumption that a certain problem $P$ is hard does it imply the hardness
of a problem $Q$. Furthermore, we are often interest in building a secure cryptographic primitives
from weak ones. Most notable example is building one way function from a weak one way function.

In this Thesis we study \textit{weakly verifiable puzzles} that generalize
many commonly encountered cryptographic primitives like message authentication codes, bit commitment protocols and CAPTCHAs, just to name a few.
The characteristic property of weakly verifiable puzzles is that it may be hard to verify correctness of a solution.
A notable example is CAPTCHA where a problem of checking whether solution is correct is comparable hard to find a correct solution.

\begin{todo}
  \textbf{TODO:} Model problems as games
\end{todo}

The weakly verifiable puzzles has been studies before.
In this Thesis we combine the previous works and show that it is possible to hardness of weakly verifiable puzzles.

\section{Weakly verifiable puzzles}
There has been previous works on weakly verifiable puzzles.
The notion was introduced by Ran Cannetti, Sahi Halevi, and Michael Steiner in \cite{canetti2004hardness} and
focused on cryptographic primitives for which solution can be efficiently verified only by a party generating the puzzle.
The earlier results in cryptography showed hardness amplification for inverting one-way function which was shown by Yao that
inverting many independent instances of one way functions is indeed harder than inverting just a single instance of one-way function.
However, the classical proof of Yao found in \cite{Goldreich:2000:FCB:519078} relies in the great extent that it is easy to verify
correctness of a solution.
To show the hardness amplification for weakly verifiable puzzles a different approach has to be found.
It was first introduced by Ran Cannettig, Sahi Halevi, and Micheal Steiner.
There are situations where we do not require that not all puzzles are solved but only a part of them.
A prominent example are hard AI problems where a human and computer programs should be distinguished.


\section{Contribution of the Thesis}

\section{Organization of the Thesis}
In the next chapter we lay down notation and terminology used in the Thesis.
In Chapter \ref{ch:intro_weakly} we given an overview of cryptographic primitives that
are weakly verifiable, and which security amplification is proved in this Thesis.
Furthermore, we give outline of earlier studies of weakly verifiable puzzles, and
show the contribution of this Thesis.
Finally, in Chapter \ref{ch:main_result} we formulate and prove the main theorem of this Thesis.

\chapter{Weakly Verifiable Cryptographic Primitives}
\label{ch:intro_weakly}
This chapter gives an overview of weakly verifiable cryptograph primitives.
We start by formulating a definition of a \textit{dynamic interactive weakly verifiable puzzle} in Section \ref{section:wvp}.
To provide the Reader more intuition in Section \ref{section:wvp_examples} we describe a~series of well known cryptographic primitives
that are weakly verifiable. Section \ref{st:previous_results} is devoted to the previous research concerning different types of weakly verifiable puzzles.

\chapter{Hardness amplification for weakly verifiable puzzles}
\label{ch:main_result}
In the previous chapter we gave an overview of the former studies of different types of weakly verifiable puzzles.
We also defined a~more general notion of a~dynamic interactive weakly verifiable puzzle.
The focus of this chapter is on a constructive proof of hardness amplification for dynamic interactive weakly verifiable puzzles.
In Section \ref{st:main_theorem} we formulate the theorem which is then proved in the succeeding sections.
We begin with constructing an algorithm that finds an efficiently computable function that is used
to partition the domain of hint and verification queries. Next, we give a proof of hardness amplification
under the assumption that the domain is well partitioned. Finally, in Section \ref{st:put_together}
we complete the proof by combining the previous steps.
