%% LaTeX Font encoding -- DO NOT CHANGE
\usepackage[OT1]{fontenc}

%% Babel provides support for languages.  'english' uses British
%% English hyphenation and text snippets like "Figure" and
%% "Theorem". Use the option 'ngerman' if your document is in German.
%% Use 'american' for American English.  Note that if you change this,
%% the next LaTeX run may show spurious errors.  Simply run it again.
%% If they persist, remove the .aux file and try again.
\usepackage[english]{babel}

%% Input encoding 'utf8'. In some cases you might need 'utf8x' for
%% extra symbols. Not all editors, especially on Windows, are UTF-8
%% capable, so you may want to use 'latin1' instead.
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}

%% This changes default fonts for both text and math mode to use Herman Zapfs
%% excellent Palatino font.  Do not change this.

%% The AMS-LaTeX extensions for mathematical typesetting.  Do not

%% NTheorem is a reimplementation of the AMS Theorem package. This

\chapter{Weakly verifiable cryptographic primitives}
In this chapter we introduce the notion of weakly verifiable puzzles. In section \ref{def:dwvp} we provide a formal definitions that
is followed by a series of cryptographic primitives that are captured by this notion.
Finally, in Section \ref{st:previous_results} we give an overview of the earlier research in this area
that is primarily covered in \cite{canetti2004hardness}, \cite{Dodis:2009:SAI:1530441.1530450}, and \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1002-3534}.

\section{Weakly verifiable puzzles}
\begin{definition}[Dynamic weakly verifiable puzzle.]
  \label{def:dwvp}
  A dynamic weakly verifiable puzzle (DWVP) is defined by a family of probabilistic circuits $\{P_n\}$.
  A circuit belonging to $\{P_n\}$ is called a problem poser.
  A solver $C := (C_1, C_2)$ for $P_n$ is a probabilistic two phase circuit.
  We write $P_n(\pi)$ to denote the execution of $P_n$ with the randomness fixed to $\pi \in \{0,1\}^n$, and $(C_1,C_2)(\rho)$
  to denote the execution of both $C_1$ and $C_2$ with the randomness fixed to $\rho \in \{0,1\}^{*}$.

  In the first phase, the problem poser $P_n(\pi)$ and the solver $C_1(\rho)$ interact.
  As the result of the interaction $P_n(\pi)$ outputs a verification circuit $\Gamma_{V}$ and a hint circuit $\Gamma_{H}$.
  The circuit $C_1(\rho)$ produces no output.
  The circuit $\Gamma_{V}$ takes as input $q \in Q$, an answer $y \in \{0,1\}^*$,
  and outputs a bit. We say that an answer $(q,y)$ is a correct solution if and only if $\Gamma_V(q,y) = 1$.
  The circuit $\Gamma_H$ on input $q \in Q$ outputs a hint such that $\Gamma_V(q,\Gamma_H(q)) = 1$.

  In the second phase, $C_2$ takes as input $x := \langle P_n(\pi), C_1(\rho) \rangle_{\mathit{trans}}$,
  and has oracle access to $\Gamma_V$ and $\Gamma_H$.
  The execution of $C_2$ with the input $x$ and the randomness fixed to $\rho$
  is denoted by $C_2(x, \rho)$. The queries of $C_2$ to $\Gamma_V$ and $\Gamma_H$ are called verification queries and hint queries respectively.
  The circuit $C_2$ succeeds if and only if it makes a verification query $(q,y)$ such that $\Gamma_V(q,y) = 1$,
  and it has not previously asked for a hint query on $q$.
