We give a proof of hardness amplification for a new type of Weakly Verifiable Puzzles that generalize the previous approaches.

An important question in cryptography is whether it is possible to build cryptographic construction that is strongly hard
from a one that is only weakly hard. The well known result of Yao states that it is feasible to build a strong one-way function
from functions that are only weakly hard.

Weakly Verifiable Puzzles can be seen as problems where a solution cannot be efficiently verified by a party that solves a puzzle.
The problem of hardness amplification for various variants of Weakly Verifiable Puzzles has been
studied in a series of papers \cite{canetti2004hardness, Dodis:2009:SAI:1530441.1530450, DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1002-3534}.
Dodis, Impagliazz, Jaiswal, and Kabanets \cite{Dodis:2009:SAI:1530441.1530450} show that it possible to amplify hardness for Dynamic Weakly Verifiable Puzzles,
which covers the case of cryptographic primitives like message authentication codes and signature schemes.
Holenstein and Schoenebeck \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1002-3534} prove a similar result for Interactive Weakly Verifiable Puzzles that
embraces the case of constructions like bit commitment protocols.

In this thesis we introduce the notion of \textit{Dynamic Interactive Weakly Verifiable Puzzles}
that combines the previous definitions of dynamic and interactive puzzles.
Furthermore, we prove that if there is no efficient probabilistic algorithm that solves a single puzzle with probability higher than $\delta$,
then there is no efficient algorithm that solves $k$ independent instances of puzzles with probability higher than an algorithm that solves each of the $k$ puzzles
independently with probability $\delta$ and where an arbitrary binary monotone function is used to decide which of the $k$ puzzle should be solved.
