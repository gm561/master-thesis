We give a proof of hardness amplification for a new type of Weakly Verifiable Puzzles that generalize the previous research.

An important question in cryptography is whether it is possible to build cryptographic construction that is strongly hard to solve
from a one that is only weakly hard. The well known result of this type is about building a strong one-way function using functions that
are only weakly hard.

The problem of hardness amplification has been studied for various variants of Weakly Verifiable Puzzles
where a solution cannot be efficiently verified by a party that solves a puzzle.
It has been shown \cite{Dodis:2009:SAI:1530441.1530450} that it possible to amplify hardness for Dynamic Weakly Verifiable Puzzles,
which covers cryptographic primitives like message authentication codes and signature schemes.
In \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1002-3534} a similar result has been proven for Interactive Weakly Verifiable Puzzles that
embraces constructions like bit commitment protocols.

In this thesis we introduce the notion of \textit{Dynamic Interactive Weakly Verifiable Puzzles}
that generalize previous definitions of Dynamic and Interactive Weakly Verifiable Puzzles.
Furthermore, we prove that if there is no probabilistic algorithm that solves a single puzzle with probability more than $\delta - \epsilon$,
then there is no algorithm that solves $k$ independent instances of puzzles with probability higher than an algorithm that solves each of the $k$ puzzles
independently with probability $\delta$ and where an arbitrary binary monotone function is used to decide which of the $k$ puzzle has to be solved.
