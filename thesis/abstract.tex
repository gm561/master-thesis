% Absrtracts generally do not have citations.
% Information in title should not be repeated.
% Be explicit.
% Use numbers where appropriate.
% Answers to these questions should be found in the abstract:
% What did you do?

% How did you do it? State methods.
% What did you learn? State major results.
